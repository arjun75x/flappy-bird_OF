# Project Proposal
My idea for the final project would be a fork of the game Flappy Bird for iOS. I found a library called GamePlay that allows for cross platform game development and would allow me to create iOS and Mac apps through XCode on Mac all in C++. Additional details can be found here: 
[GamePlay website](http://www.gameplay3d.io), and the Open Source code can be found here: [GamePlay GitHub](https://github.com/gameplay3d/GamePlay). The library is very simple to use, with the import being simply `#include "gameplay.h"`, with all the different headers of the libraries being bundled into that one header. The header gameplay.h includes lots of headers for core functions in computers and phones including touch and keyboard functionality and includes game functions for vectors, graphics, audio, animation, physics, and more. Basically, everything I would need to actually build the game is here, I would just probably need to find some way to create or import the appropriate graphics for flappy bird to work, as in sprites for the bird and pipes and whatnot. The library also includes sample games, and all the games basically only require one .cpp file and one .h file each to work, meaning the library simplifies the structure of the game a lot. They also only need that one .cpp file and one .h file to make the game work on a variety of platforms, including iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows. Basically, the GamePlay library simplifies the development process a lot and also makes it much simpler and more accessible to use between different platforms. To integrate OpenFrameworks, I would create the game as an openFrameworks project and use some native libraries from there, but I think most of the functions would come from the GamePlay header, but I'm not sure how much code would come from each library until I start developing. I also looked and there is an openFrameworks library for iOS development, so I might try to build it based off that and use the GamePlay header there, but all that depends on how easy it is to integrate GamePlay and OpenFrameworks. All in all, the project looks like it would be fun to develop, and once I figure out the logistics of where I would get the sprite graphics of the game it's pretty much straight programming from there, as GamePlay and OpenFrameworks make it really easy to build the app to iOS devices, and beyond that to any other devices as well.

If you are not familiar with the game Flappy Bird, I will provide a basic overview here. The user opens the app onto a start screen with the title of the game and two buttons, one to play the game and one for help. The help button would lead to the help screen which would outline how to play the app, which consists of just touching the screen to jump, and that's it. The duration of the tap affects the height the bird jumps, but that's all there is to the game.  The play button would direct the user to the game, and basically the game would randomly generate pipes from the ceiling and floor of various heights and the user would need to jump up and down to navigate through the pipes. The game would keep track of each pipe the user goes through and increment the score by 1. In the end I would hope to keep track of the top 10 scores much like we did in ofSnake. Attached is a picture of the app below:

Update to proposal 4/27:

So integrating GamePlay and OpenFrameworks is a bit more difficult than I anticipated, as OpenFrameworks projects are basically a proprietary type of project that makes them hard to work with another type of game library, such as GamePlay. Because of this, I want to use ofImage and ofSoundPlayer as my external libraries, as they make loading images and sound into the game a lot simpler.
