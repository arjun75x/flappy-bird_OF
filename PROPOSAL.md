# Project Proposal
My idea for the final project would be a fork of the game Flappy Bird for iOS. To integrate OpenFrameworks, I would create the game as an openFrameworks project and use some native libraries from there. The libraries I'm using are ofRectangle, ofImage, and ofSoundPlayer. Most of the game physics and logic is based off of the ofRectangle library, where I would create the pipes and the bird as rectangles and use the inbuilt functions in ofRectangle for moving the positions and regenerating the pipes as the game moves on. ofImage and ofSoundPlayer are my external libraries, where ofImage handles all the graphics of the game and ofSoundPlayer handles all the sounds of the game. ofImage has inbuilt functions to draw the pictures based on the location of the ofRectangles, so all I have to do is call that function in the draw functions. ofSoundPlayer is very simple, where I simply play the respective sounds when the bird is jumping and when it hits a pipe. Overall, the game was pretty straightforward to develop.

If you are not familiar with the game Flappy Bird, I will provide a basic overview here. The user opens the app onto a start screen with the title of the game and two buttons, one to play the game and one for help. The help button would lead to the help screen which would outline how to play the app, which consists of just touching the screen to jump, and that's it. The duration of the tap affects the height the bird jumps, but that's all there is to the game.  The play button would direct the user to the game, and basically the game would randomly generate pipes from the ceiling and floor of various heights and the user would need to jump up and down to navigate through the pipes. The game would keep track of each pipe the user goes through and increment the score by 1. In the end I would hope to keep track of the top 10 scores much like we did in ofSnake. Attached is a picture of the app below:
